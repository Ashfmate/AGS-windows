# AGS Windows
Window widgets from AGS

## Description
A repo full of window widgets that I have created using AGS. I believe that I am going to be throwing those away so quick so why not save them somewhere

## Preconditions
You will need GTK 3 (bruh, Aylur please update) also node and some JS stuff I am too low level to understand.
You would also need to know a little about programming in general. JS is pretty easy to get the hang of.

## Motivation

- My best friend [Brhoom](https://github.com/Hetari).
- So that I can save my progress online.
- I don't know JS, so if I have some issues, anyone can help online.

## TODO
Literally an entire monitor's worth of widgets. I will be populating once I really plan it out.

## References
Of course [AGS](https://github.com/Aylur/ags) and really that is it.

## Contribution
Make an issue, though a pull request is welcome as well
